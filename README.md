# Sleep Stage Prediction Research

## Inspiration
Our journey into sleep stage prediction research is deeply rooted in personal experiences with sleep issues and alarming statistics. A study by Peppard et al. notes that about 30% of adults in the U.S. suffer from insomnia. Moreover, over 50 million Americans are diagnosed with sleep disorders, including approximately 25 million with Sleep-Disordered Breathing (SDB). These staggering figures, coupled with our personal challenges, drive our focus on understanding and diagnosing Sleep Disorders (SD) to enhance treatment and management.

## What It Does
Our project presents models capable of accurately diagnosing sleep stages using physiological datasets. This approach is pivotal in understanding and treating various sleep disorders effectively.

## How We Built It
We employed two innovative technologies:
1. A combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
2. The CatBoost algorithm.

These methodologies are designed to analyze physiological data and have achieved accuracies of 73.04% and 80.10%, respectively.

## Challenges We Ran Into
A significant challenge was the mismatch in the format of the initially provided dataset. After notifying the committee, the datasets were corrected, allowing us to proceed effectively.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
Our key achievements include:
- Developing innovative methods for sleep stage diagnosis.
- Attaining high accuracy rates with our models.
- Gaining valuable insights from working with real-world data.

## What We Learned
This project underscored the difference between working with theoretical problems and real-world data. The complexity and unpredictability of real data require adaptable solutions and a deeper understanding of the underlying variables.

## What's Next for Untitled
Moving forward, we plan to:
1. Integrate personalized sleep recommendations into the model to assist with sleep hygiene and lifestyle adjustments.
2. Implement an online learning method, enabling the model to adapt and improve continuously as it encounters new data.
3. Explore the potential of transfer learning from pre-trained models on related tasks, especially to enhance performance with limited labeled data.
